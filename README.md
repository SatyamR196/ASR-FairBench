#####  Congratulations ðŸ¤— ! on sucessfully cloning the frontend, next we will be setting up the backend on google colab

###  <u>Backend</u> :  
- Open the Google Colab notebook using the link below.

Link to Backend Server Collab notebook : <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nIA8IyejvuRauvFbOCbpRlN1sEIK01Gh#scrollTo=_bZc5hkTEfWE"> Click here </a>

- Open your google drive, Create a folder named "ASR_Fairness_Dataset" and upload the above colab notebook there.

- You also need to upload the dataset to your google drive. Download the dataset from the link below, name it "asr_fairness_audio" and upload it to the same folder "ASR_Fairness_Dataset" in your google drive. [Dataset Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T0HkE-pFED7fRjAmnIncxmMTuHZDPv-7)

- Additionally, you can also download the CSV files which contains the results of the ASR models on the dataset. You need to place the folders in the folder "ASR_Fairness_Dataset" in your google drive.

[Facebook Model Result Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-VDnwbLPDrUWdw67x-KUYYQ46PFT5lbd?usp=drive_link)

- finally, you need to download the test.csv file which contains the details about audio dataset like gender,ethnicity,etc. You need to place the folders in the folder "ASR_Fairness_Dataset" in your google drive.  
 [test.csv Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-54UJWB7g9pXB8t5X6wYdBA_KClRIgLf/view?usp=drive_link)

- Now, your drive folder structure should look like this :

- Before running the Backend server on colab notebook, make sure to sign up on ngrok and get your auth token and replace it in colab notebook. [Ngok Website](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken)
![](/public/ngrok_token.png)

```bash
!ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR NGROK TOKEN>
```

- Now, run the colab notebook. It will ask for permission to access your google drive, allow it.

- After running the notebook, ngok will give you a public url to access the backend server api. Copy the link and paste it in the frontend code, App.jsx , baseUrl.

**Note :** If you change the name of any the folder, make sure to change the path in the colab notebook as well.

#####  Sucessful ðŸ¤— ! now you can run the application on your local machine
